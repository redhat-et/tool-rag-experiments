You should response ""Solved"" when:
    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is ""Solved"". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.
	2.	Consider only Completeness:
	    •	The answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.
	3.	For Multi-part Queries:
	    •	For queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered “Solved”.
	4.	Genuine Attempt :
	    •	The answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that “nothing” is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).

You should response ""Unsolved"" when:
    1.	Refusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:
	    •	The answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., “I'm sorry, I can't help with that”).
	    •	The answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.
	2.	Multi-part Queries:
	    •	If the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.
    3. Severe Factual Error:
        •   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.


Additional Guidelines:
    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.
    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.
	2.	Focus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.
	3.	Answer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.

    1. If the answer well provides the information needed by the query, then it is ""Solved"". The answer does not need to be perfect, and it only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.
	2.	Consider only Completeness:
	    •	The answer attempts to address every part of the query, regardless of whether the information provided is factually correct or accurate, unless there is a severe factual error.
	3.	For Multi-part Queries:
	    •	For queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered “Solved”.
	4.	Genuine Attempt :
	    •	The answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that “nothing” is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).

You should response ""Unsolved"" when:
    1.	Refusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:
	    •	The answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., “I'm sorry, I can't help with that”).
	    •	The answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.
	2.	Multi-part Queries:
	    •	If the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.
    3. Severe Factual Error:
        •   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.


Additional Guidelines:
    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.
    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.
	2.	Focus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.
	3.	Answer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.

	3.	For Multi-part Queries:
	    •	For queries with multiple parts, all parts must be addressed for the answer to be considered “Solved”.
	4.	Genuine Attempt :
	    •	The answer makes a genuine attempt to provide the requested information or perform the requested task for all parts of the query. This includes scenarios where the answer concludes that “nothing” is a reasonable response (e.g., when the requested information does not exist or is not available, or a possible answer of the query is nothing and the model answers nothing after reasonable attempts).

You should response ""Unsolved"" when:
    1.	Refusal, Apology, or Non-engagement:
	    •	The answer includes a refusal or apology (e.g., “I'm sorry, I can't help with that”).
	    •	The answer does not directly engage with or address the query in any way.
	2.	Multi-part Queries:
	    •	If the query has multiple parts and at least one part is not well addressed.
    3. Severe Factual Error:
        •   If the answer contains a severe factual error that significantly impacts the usefulness of the information provided.


Additional Guidelines:
    1. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE TOO HARSH. The model does not need to be perfect, and the answer does not need to be flawless. It only needs to make a genuine attempt to address the query.
    1. DO NOT evaluate factual accuracy or correctness of the information provided based on your knowledge. Assume that the information provided is accurate and focus solely on whether the answer attempts to address all parts of the query, unless there is a severe factual error that conficts common knowledge.
	2.	Focus on Final Answer: Only the final answer is provided and should be considered, disregarding any processes that were used to generate the answer. You only need to judge whether the information need is satisfied.
	3.	Answer Completion: The agent does not need to detail how it arrived at the answer, only that the answer itself is complete and attempts to address the query.
